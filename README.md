1) The SuperSimpleStock.py script is working with Python 3.3.3 and it will not work with Python 2 (any version).

2) Some of the module of PyAlgoTrade-0.17 package was modified by me, in order to make it compatible with Python 3 version.
   For that reason it is recommended to use the PyAlgoTrade library uploaded in this repository.
   
3) It was used pandas version 0.16.2 for mac. Since pandas library contains stuff that has been compiled specifically for python 3.3 and the mac I suggest to install pandas version compatible with your platform.

4) It was used yahoo-finance version 1.2.1.
