1) The SuperSimpleStock.py script is working with Python 3.3.3 and it will not work with Python 2 (any version).

2) Some of the module of PyAlgoTrade-0.17 package was modified by me, in order to make it compatible with Python 3 version.
   For that reason it is recommended to use the PyAlgoTrade library uploaded in this repository.
   
3) It was used pandas version 0.16.2 and yahoo-finance version 1.2.1
